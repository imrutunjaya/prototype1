1. Number System: Basics and Classification

Types of Numbers:


---

2. Fundamental Concepts

a. Divisibility Rules (Shortcuts)


---

3. Factorial (!)

Definition:
n! = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × ... × 1
Example:
5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120

Useful Concepts:

0! = 1 (by definition)

Trailing zeros in n!:
Count how many times 5 is a factor:
n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ...
(Use floor division)



---

4. Modulus (|a|)

Definition:
|a| = a if a ≥ 0
|a| = -a if a < 0

Examples:

|5| = 5

|-3| = 3

|x| = a → x = ±a



---

5. Greatest Integer Function (GIF) or Floor Function

Notation: ⌊x⌋ or [x]
It gives the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

Examples:

⌊3.7⌋ = 3

⌊-2.4⌋ = -3

⌊5⌋ = 5
Note: Think of this as "rounding down."



---

6. Shortcut Tricks for Multiplication

a. Vedic Math Tricks:

i. Multiplying numbers near base:

Example: 98 × 97 (close to 100)
→ 98 = 100 - 2
→ 97 = 100 - 3
→ Cross-subtract: 98 - 3 = 95
→ Multiply differences: 2×3 = 06
→ Answer = 9506


ii. 2-digit × 2-digit:

Example: 23 × 21
Use formula:
(20+3)(20+1) = 400 + 20 + 60 + 3 = 483



---

7. Prime Numbers and Co-primes

Prime Number: Has only 2 factors: 1 and itself
(e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...)

Co-prime Numbers: GCD = 1 (e.g., 4 and 9)



---

8. LCM and HCF (Shortcut Approach)

HCF (GCD):

Prime factorization and choose lowest powers


LCM:

Prime factorization and choose highest powers


Shortcut formula:
HCF × LCM = Product of two numbers


---

9. Types of Questions

a. Find last digit:

Look for cyclicity (pattern of units digit):

2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 6, then repeat


b. Find number of zeroes in a factorial:

Use n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ...

c. Division by modulus:

(a mod m) = Remainder when a is divided by m


---

10. Short Tricks for Fast Calculations

Multiplication by 5:
n × 5 = (n × 10) ÷ 2

Squaring ending in 5:
(25)² → 2×3 = 6 → 625
i.e., (a5)² = a(a+1)25



---

11. Important Number Properties

Even × Even = Even

Odd × Odd = Odd

Even + Odd = Odd

Odd + Odd = Even



---
