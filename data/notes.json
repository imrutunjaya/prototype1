1. Basics of Number System

Types of Numbers:

Type	Example	Description

Natural Numbers	1, 2, 3,...	Counting numbers (starts from 1)
Whole Numbers	0, 1, 2,...	Natural numbers + 0
Integers	-3, -2, 0, 1...	Positive, negative & zero
Rational Numbers	1/2, 4, 0.75	Can be expressed as p/q
Irrational Numbers	√2, π	Cannot be expressed as p/q
Real Numbers	All of the above	All possible numbers on the number line


Key Concepts:

Even Numbers: Divisible by 2 (2, 4, 6,…)

Odd Numbers: Not divisible by 2 (1, 3, 5,…)

Prime Numbers: Only divisible by 1 and itself (2, 3, 5, 7,…)

Composite Numbers: Have more than two factors (4, 6, 8,…)

Co-prime: GCD is 1 (e.g., 8 and 15)

2. Divisibility Rules (Short Tricks)

Divisible by	Rule

2	Last digit is even
3	Sum of digits divisible by 3
4	Last 2 digits divisible by 4
5	Ends in 0 or 5
6	Divisible by both 2 and 3
7	Double the last digit and subtract from the rest
8	Last 3 digits divisible by 8
9	Sum of digits divisible by 9
10	Ends in 0
11	Alternating sum of digits divisible by 11


Tip: Practice rules with 2-digit and 3-digit numbers for speed.

3. Important Concepts

a. HCF and LCM

HCF (Highest Common Factor): Greatest number dividing two or more numbers
LCM (Least Common Multiple): Smallest number divisible by two or more numbers

Trick:

\text{HCF} \times \text{LCM} = \text{Product of the numbers}


---

b. Factorization

Number of factors: If a number ,
then total factors = 

Sum of factors:

\text{Sum} = (1 + a + a^2 + \ldots + a^p)(1 + b + \ldots + b^q)...


---

c. Remainder Theorem & Shortcuts

 means both give same remainder when divided by m

: Use Euler’s Theorem or Cyclic Patterns


Trick for remainder with powers: Example: Find 

Check pattern:

 → pattern: 3, 1, 3, 1… (cycle of 2)
So 


---

4. Number Patterns and Shortcuts

a. Sum of Series

---

b. Digital Root (Casting Out 9s)

Use it to simplify large numbers in addition or multiplication:

Example: Check if 5487 × 23 = 126201
Sum of digits: 5+4+8+7=24 → 2+4=6
2+3=5 → 6×5=30 → 3+0=3
1+2+6+2+0+1=12 → 1+2=3 (Matches! Correct)

---

5. Base Systems

Conversions:

Binary to Decimal: Multiply with powers of 2

Decimal to Binary: Divide by 2, write remainders in reverse


Trick for Hexadecimal: Groups of 4-bits for conversion
E.g., Binary 1101 1110 = Hex DE


---

6. Important Question Types for Exams

Type	Trick

Find last digit of large power	Look for cyclicity (e.g., units digit of 7^101)
Remainder problems	Apply Fermat/Euler/Cyclic patterns
HCF/LCM type	Use prime factorization + formula
Base system questions	Convert using simple division/multiplication

---

7. Practice Tricks (Examples)

Example 1: Find the last digit of 

Pattern of units digit of 7: 7, 9, 3, 1 (cycle of 4)

222 ÷ 4 = remainder 2 → 2nd number in cycle = 9


Example 2: Remainder when  is divided by 5?

Pattern of : 2, 4, 3, 1 (cycle of 4)

32 mod 4 = 0 → 4th in cycle = 1

---

8. Preparation Strategy

Day 3–5: Master HCF, LCM, factor concepts with tricks

Day 6–7: Practice remainder, cyclic patterns, series

Day 8–9: Focus on base conversions & digital roots

Day 10+: Practice 20–30 mixed questions daily
